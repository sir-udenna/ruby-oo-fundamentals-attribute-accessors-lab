## Introduction

In this lab, you'll be creating a Cat class. Every instance of a Cat should have
a name and be able to meow. In other words, I should be able to do:

```ruby
maru = Cat.new
maru.name = "Maru"

maru.name
# => "Maru"

maru.meow
# "meow!"
# => nil
```

## Instructions

Run the test suite to get started. You'll be writing all your code in the `lib/meowing_cat.rb` file.

1. Define a class, called Cat.
2. Use the `attr_accessor` macro to create a setter and getter method for a cat's name.
4. Write a method, `.meow`, that outputs "meow!" to the terminal using the `puts` method when called on an instance of Cat.
